<h1>These are the Lyrics to Princes of the Universe
</h1>

    Here we are.
    Born to be kings.
    We're the princes of the universe.
    
    Here we belong.
    Fighting to survive in a war with the darkest powers.
    
    And here we are.
    We're the princes of the universe.
    Here we belong,
    Fighting for survival.
    We've come to be the rulers of your world.
    
    I am immortal.
    I have inside me blood of kings.
    I have no rival.
    No man can be my equal.
    Take me to the future of your world.
    
    Born to be kings.
    Princes of the universe.
    Fighting and free.
    Got your world in my hand.
    I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand.
    We were born to be princes of the universe.
    
    No man could understand.
    My power is in my own hand.
    Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
    People talk about you.
    People say you've had your day.
    
    I'm a man that will go far.
    Fly the moon and reach for the stars,
    With my sword and head held high.
    Got to pass the test first time.
    
    I know that people talk about me.
    I hear it every day,
    But I can prove you wrong
    'Cause I'm right first time.
    
    Alright, let's go, let's go, ha, ha.
    Watch this man fly.
    Bring on the girls.
    Come on, come on, come on.
    
    Here we are.
    Born to be kings.
    We're the princes of the universe.
    Here we belong.
    
    Born to be kings.
    Princes of the universe.
    Fighting and free.
    Got your world in my hand.
    I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand.
    We were born to be princes of the universe.</html>
